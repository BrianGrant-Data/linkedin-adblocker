As for how you use it, here’s what you do:


* Click your browser’s “burger menu” on the top right corner or visit Settings directly
* Navigate to ‘Extensions’
* Toggle on “Developer Mode”, which is usually on the top right corner of the ‘Extensions Page’
* Some buttons should have appeared on the top of the page. Click “Load Unpacked”
* Select your project directory from the File Browser
* You’re all set!
If you’ve followed all the steps correctly, you should now have a new icon where you extensions are located, also on the top right.

Since we didn’t set an icon for it, it’s probably going to be an ‘L’ inside of a square.

Now go ahead and test it out! Here’s a handy link to LinkedIn.
